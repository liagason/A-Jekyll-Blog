Hi there! I'm Sotiris Liagas (Σωτήρης Λιάγκας).

I'm an elementary school teacher and self-taught programmer. I currently teach math, science and greek language to sixth grade students.

In 2020, I cofounded [Elemedu](https://elemedu.com), a free and open source lesson plan sharing platform for elementary school teachers.

Check out my open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/liagason) or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/liagason).
