Hey there!  
I'm Sotiris Liagas (Σωτήρης Λιάγκας).

I'm an elementary school teacher and self-taught programmer. I currently teach math, science and greek language to sixth grade students.

In 2020, I cofounded [Elemedu](https://elemedu.com) with [Nefeli Kostakopoulou](https://nefeli.dev). It's a free and open source lesson plan sharing platform for elementary school teachers located in Greece & Cyprus.

[Here you can read my thoughts](https://liagason.com) about edtech, teaching, programming and teaching programming!
