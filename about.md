Hi there! I'm Sotiris Liagas (Σωτήρης Λιάγκας).

I'm an elementary school teacher and self-taught programmer. I currently teach math, science and greek language to sixth grade students.

In 2020, I cofounded Elemedu, a free and open source lesson plan sharing platform for elementary school teachers.

Check out my open source projects on Github or send me a message on Twitter.
