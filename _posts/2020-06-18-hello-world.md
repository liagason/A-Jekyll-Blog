Welcome to my blog!  
I have recently migrated my website from [Typecho](https://typecho.org) to Github Pages as it provides super fast free hosting and is easier to maintain!  
I took me some googling and a just couple of hours to set it up and running!  
I don't think I'll import any previous posts for the time, but I'll start posting new stuff soon.  
Thanks for visiting!
